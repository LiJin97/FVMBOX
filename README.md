# FVMBOX
This a research tool for solving diffusion problem by finite volume method. It provides three numerical examples to test  this method.
 
 The file name dis_scalar is the example of sloving diffusion problem wtih discontinuous scalar coefficient.
 
 The file name dis_tensor is the example of sloving diffusion problem wtih discontinuous tensor coefficient.
 
 The file name mixBoundary is the example of solvinf diffusion problem with mix Robin boundary condition.
 
FVMBOX is written in the prototyping language, MATLAB.
